# Ambient Weather REST API

Access an Ambient Weather user's weather station data programmatically using our REST API

##### Authentication

Two API Keys are required for all REST API requests:

+ `applicationKey` - identifies the developer / application. To create an application key please login to your AmbientWeather.net account page (https://ambientweather.net/account)
+ `apiKey` - grants access to past/present data for a given user's devices.  A typical consumer-facing application will initially ask the user to create an `apiKey` on their AmbientWeather.net account page (https://ambientweather.net/account) and paste it into the app.  Developers for personal or in-house apps will also need to create an apiKey on their own account page.

##### Rate Limiting

API requests are capped at 1 request/second for each user's apiKey and 3 requests/second per applicationKey.  When this limit is exceeded, the API will return a 429 response code. Please be kind to our servers :)

# Group Ambient Realtime API

Access an Ambient Weather user's weather station data in realtime using our Realtime API


##### Authentication

You will be working with two types of keys when using the Realtime API:

+ `applicationKey` - identifies the developer / application. This key is passed to the server when you make the initial connection
+ `apiKey` - identifies a user. This key grants read-only access to all of the devices for a given user. It is used in the `subscribe` command (see below)

##### Websockets

The realtime API uses Websockets and is based on Socket.io (https://socket.io/). The easiest way to use the API is to use a Socket.io helper library. They are available in most languages.

Socket.io Endpoint: `https://rt2.ambientweather.net/?api=1&applicationKey=....`

* The realtime subdomain is different than the REST subdomain (realtime = `rt2`, REST = `rt`). 
* Include query parameters `api=1` to identify the api version 
* Include `applicationKey=....` to identify your application

Upon successful connection, you'll send commands and listen for responses.


##### Helper Libraries

+ Node.js - https://github.com/owise1/ambient-weather-api

###### Command: connect

Connect to the Realtime API

###### Command: disconnect

Disconnect from the Realtime API

###### Command: subscribe

Listen for new data from all the devices for users' apiKeys.

command body - an object containing the property apiKeys that is an array of apiKeys:
```
{
    apiKeys:
        [
            'multiple',
            'apiKeys',
            'are fine'
        ]
}
```

###### Command: unsubscribe

Stop listening for new data from all the devices for users' apiKeys.

command body - an object containing the property apiKeys that is an array of apiKeys:
```
{
    apiKeys:
        [
            'multiple',
            'apiKeys',
            'are fine'
        ]
}
```


##### Event: subscribed

`subscribed` events are emitted after you send a `subscribe` or `unsubscribe` command. It will list all of the devices you are currently subscribed to and, if applicable, will return apiKeys that are not valid.

event body - an object containing one or more properties
+ `devices` - an array containing objects for all of the devices you are currently subscribed to
+ `invalidApiKeys` - an array of apiKeys that aren't valid
